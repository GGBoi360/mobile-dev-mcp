# Mobile Dev MCP - Dual License

This project uses a dual-license model ("Open Core"):

## Free Tools (8 tools) - MIT License

The **8 free tools** are licensed under the **MIT License**.
See [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) for the full text.

These tools are open source - free to use, modify, and distribute:

**Android Debugging (7 tools):**
- screenshot_emulator, list_devices, get_device_info, get_app_info
- get_adb_logs, get_metro_logs, check_metro_status

**License (1 tool):**
- get_license_status

Note: MIT license means the code is open source and free to use forever.

## Advanced Tools (13 tools) - Elastic License 2.0

The **13 advanced tools** are licensed under the **Elastic License 2.0**.
See [LICENSE-ELASTIC](LICENSE-ELASTIC) for the full text.

This means:
- You CAN use them for personal or commercial projects
- You CAN modify and create derivative works
- You CANNOT offer this as a hosted/managed service
- You CANNOT remove or circumvent the license key functionality

Advanced tools include:
- iOS Simulator support (screenshots, logs, device info)
- UI tree inspection and element finding
- Screen analysis and text extraction
- Multi-device support

## Why Dual License?

We believe in open source while also needing to sustain development:

- **MIT for Free**: Enables the community to freely use, learn from, and contribute to core Android debugging
- **Elastic for Advanced**: Protects the commercial features that fund ongoing development
